## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or later)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bantoinese83/trackrights.git
   cd trackrights
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🗄️ Database Setup

TrackRights uses **Neon PostgreSQL** for data persistence and real-time statistics.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a Neon Database:**
   - Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
   - Create a new project
   - Copy the connection string

2. **Add to Environment:**

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string
   ```

   ⚠️ **Security Note:** Never commit your actual database connection string to version control.

### Database Schema

The application uses three main tables:

1. **`contracts`**
   - Stores all contract analyses (original, simplified, revised)
   - Tracks processing time and contract type

2. **`users`**
   - Tracks unique users via session IDs
   - Maintains user statistics (total contracts, first/last active dates)

3. **`contract_analyses`**
   - Detailed analysis records
   - Links contracts to users
   - Tracks success/failure and processing times

### API Endpoints

- **`/api/stats`** (GET) - Returns real-time statistics
- **`/api/track-contract`** (POST) - Tracks contract analyses (called automatically)

## 🎯 Quality Gates

TrackRights maintains a **100/100 quality score** with comprehensive quality gates.

### Quality Check Commands

```bash
# Individual checks
npm run type-check      # TypeScript validation
npm run lint            # ESLint validation
npm run format:check    # Prettier validation
npm run knip            # Dependency analysis

# Combined checks
npm run quality-check   # All checks except build
npm run quality-gate    # Complete quality gate (recommended)
```

### Quality Gate Pipeline

The `quality-gate` script runs:

1. ✅ **Type Check** - TypeScript strict mode validation
2. ✅ **Lint** - ESLint with zero errors/warnings
3. ✅ **Format Check** - Prettier formatting validation
4. ✅ **Knip** - Unused code and dependency analysis
5. ✅ **Build** - Production build verification

### TypeScript Strict Mode

All strict checks are enabled:

- ✅ `strict: true`
- ✅ `noImplicitAny: true`
- ✅ `strictNullChecks: true`
- ✅ `noUnusedLocals: true`
- ✅ `noUnusedParameters: true`
- ✅ `noImplicitOverride: true`
- ✅ And more...

### Current Quality Score

| Check       | Status      | Score       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| TypeScript  | ✅ Pass     | 100/100     |
| ESLint      | ✅ Pass     | 100/100     |
| Prettier    | ✅ Pass     | 100/100     |
| Knip        | ✅ Pass     | 100/100     |
| Build       | ✅ Pass     | 100/100     |
| **Overall** | **✅ Pass** | **100/100** |
